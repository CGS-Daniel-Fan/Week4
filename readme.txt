Use this repository to save all your passwords for the Over the Wire: Bandit Challenges! You may have to go through some of them again to note down the passwords, which should be a breeze for you now!

Open the project up in Atom.

Every time you find a new password, edit the file in the relevant folder. Paste in the password you have found, and list out the steps you took to find the password.
